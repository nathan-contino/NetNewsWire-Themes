# NetNewsWire-Themes
Themes I created custom for my the NetNewsWire RSS client.

## Ubuntu

This is the default theme, but it uses Canonical's [Ubuntu font family](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) for text, titles, and code.
Personally I like the default theme's styling just fine, but the San Francisco font isn't particularly pleasing to my eye.
This replaces all San Francisco font types with Ubuntu font types. Be sure to install the Ubuntu font family before you install this,
or it'll end up falling back to... less pleasant fonts.
